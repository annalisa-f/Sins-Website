            <h3>Welcome to Sins of a Stolen Skin!  Read on for instructions.</h3>
            <p>As a 'choose your own adventure' comic, this might be kinda different to web comics you've read before. Instead of just clicking 'next' after you've read a page, you're given a decision to make, and you'll be taken to a different part of the comic depending on your choice. You can always hit the back arrow in your browser if you change your mind, and by creating an account and logging in you'll be able to bookmark and save your place for when you want to read more.</p>
            <p>That's all for the basics, so if you think you're ready for a journey that takes you around the universe and into some sticky political encounters, click the 'Comic' tab up the top to start reading.</p>
